    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>In respect to what I read, I tend to read quite a bit of philosophy 
        and science fiction. I have read Machiavelli, Marcus Aurelius, 
        a bit of Epicurus, a bit of Spinoza. In terms of science fiction 
        I have read almost the entire halo expanded universe and star wars, 
        and a bit of the classics, like Issac Asimov's foundations. Here is a list of
        some of the bookos I have read or am currently reading.</p>
